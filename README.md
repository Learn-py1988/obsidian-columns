# Obsidian Columns

Allows you to create columns in Obsidian

Adds two codeblock languages: col and md.
The md codeblock is just markdown
The col codeblock renders each markdown element as its own column.
- use the md codeblock to group elements as one column

## TODO

1. Enable syntax highlighting for editor.
2. Allow you to modify the flex-grow attribute somehow
3. Allow you to create columns without codeblocks with special syntax
